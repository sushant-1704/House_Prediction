# House_Prediction
This is the project of Data Science and Machine Learning in which the goal is to predict the price of the houses of the California by analysing various parameters. For this I used the python library pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and Machine Learning package sklearn. After importing the dataset from the system(downloaded from Kaggle), I checked for the info of the dataset and then viewing and dropping null values. Then making the train and test split and joining the training X and y for ease of analysing. Plotting the graphs, histogram and heatmap for analysing correlation clearly.Taking the logarithm for Normalisation of graphs and then one hot encoding for object datatype.Defined new parameters using old one.Used LinearRegression of Supervised Machine Learning for the predictions and then standardscaler for scaling the output score.Again used RandomForestRegressor of Supervised Machine Learning for the predictions and then standardscaler for scaling the output score.And compared between the two models for best results. Lastly used GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning for finding the best combination of hyperparameter for our model RandomForestRegressor.
